# Portable Air-Ventilated Resting Bed

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Portable Air-Ventilated Resting Bed** is a healthcare-oriented engineering project designed to enhance patient comfort by providing controlled air inflation and deflation in resting pillows or bed sections. The system helps in reducing pressure accumulation, improving blood circulation, and preventing pressure sores, making it suitable for hospitals, elderly care, home healthcare, and emergency medical environments.

This project integrates **embedded systems and automated control** to deliver a cost-effective and portable healthcare solution.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a **portable and economical** air-ventilated resting system  
- Automate **air inflation and deflation cycles** using a microcontroller  
- Improve **patient comfort and pressure distribution**  
- Develop a scalable solution for healthcare and MSME applications

## 🧠 System Description
The system is controlled using an **ESP8266 microcontroller**, which drives multiple relays connected to air pumps and valves. These relays regulate the airflow into inflatable air chambers placed in the resting bed or pillows. A predefined timing logic ensures alternating pressure distribution to avoid prolonged stress on specific body parts.

The design allows future expansion with IoT and sensor-based feedback mechanisms.

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. The ESP8266 initializes the relay control pins during startup.
2. Relays are activated in a programmed sequence to:
   - Inflate selected air chambers  
   - Deflate other chambers simultaneously
3. Controlled time delays ensure balanced air circulation.
4. The cycle repeats continuously to maintain comfort and pressure relief.
